Analysis of EconomicMobility file

We are interested in the difference between eastern and western mobility. We first look at the summary statistics, and see that their range are different, western's is wider than eastern's. We first do a p-value test on SD, CV and SK respectively. And from the p-value table, we can see that eastern mobility is different from western mobility based on their standard deviation. And finally, we combine the discrepancy test measures into a single test of significance using minimum p-value for each test and get the same result that western mobility is different from eastern mobility.
